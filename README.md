This is a repository for some of my code samples for the purpose of applying to jobs or sharing with anyone interested. 
The first zip file contains a compiler for an invented language that I created for school, written in OCaml. The language is basic, but is object-oriented and allows for user defined objects.
usage for the compiler:
the programming language is outline in the spec p5.pdf
to run code use ./main.byte code.ru  (loads machine instructions into rubec.out) then ./run.byte rubec.out will run the instructions

The second zip file is a relatively straightforward graph implementation written in C
